              "'Selective Self-Training for semi-supervised Learning. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a study that efficiently exploits a large amount of unlabeled data to improve performance in conditions of limited labeled data. Most of the conventional SSL methods assume that the classes of unlabeled data are included in the set of classes of labeled data. In addition, these methods do not sort out useless unlabeled samples and use all the unlabeled data for learning, which is not suitable for realistic situations. In this paper, we propose an SSL method called selective self-training (SST), which selectively decides whether to include each unlabeled sample in the training process. It is also designed to be applied to a more real situation where classes of unlabeled data are different from the ones of the labeled data. For the conventional SSL problems which deal with data where both the labeled and unlabeled samples share the same class categories, the proposed method not only performs comparable to other conventional SSL algorithms but also can be combined with other SSL algorithms. While the conventional methods cannot be applied to the new SSL problems where the separated data do not share the classes, our method does not show any performance degradation even if the classes of unlabeled data are different from those of the labeled data.. This is an novel, interesting paper on an important topic: semi-supervised learning. Even though the proposed approach seems to have significant potential, the experimental is somewhat disorganized, and it also includes some weak claims that should be removed. For example, the number of labeled examples in Table 1 is fairly large and inconsistent (4K, 1K, 10K for the 3 organic datasets). In this reviewer*s opinion, it would be a lot more reasonable to have instead a learning curve showing the results for, say, 100, 500, 1K, 5K, and 10K labeled examples for all three domains. In 4.1, you are using different epsilon policies for synthetic vs organic datasets; why? The explanation for underperforming on SVHM (page 7) may be valid, but you could easily prove it right or wrong by adding an option to SST for \"stratified SSL.\" Without this extra work, your claim is just a conjecture. You should also show the performance of regular SSL methods in the setup on Table 4. Last but not least, you have repeatedly made the claim combining SST and other SSL may further improve the performance; however, you do not provide any evidence for it, so you should avoid making such claims. Other comments: - on page 2, the two terms classification & selection network appear \"out of the blue;\" it would be quite helpful to make it clear from the abstract that the proposed implementation is for neural networks. - figures 2 & 3 should be a lot larger in order to be readable - 4.1.2 top of page 7: claims such as \"SST could have obtained better performance\" have no place in such a paper; you could instead make a note about the method being \"prohibitively CPU intensive for the time being\" - lower on the same page you say: \"SST may get better performance\" - see above.

        "sample_dataset = ['Parametric Adversarial Divergences are Good Task Losses for Generative Modeling. Generative modeling of high dimensional data like images is a notoriously difficult and ill-defined problem. In particular, how to evaluate a learned generative model is unclear. In this paper, we argue that *adversarial learning*, pioneered with generative adversarial networks (GANs), provides an interesting framework to implicitly define more meaningful task losses for unsupervised tasks, such as for generating \"visually realistic\" images. By relating GANs and structured prediction under the framework of statistical decision theory, we put into light links between recent advances in structured prediction theory and the choice of the divergence in GANs. We argue that the insights about the notions of \"hard\" and \"easy\" to learn losses can be analogously extended to adversarial divergences. We also discuss the attractive properties of parametric adversarial divergences for generative modeling, and perform experiments to show the importance of choosing a divergence that reflects the final task.. This paper takes some steps in the direction of understanding adversarial learning/GAN and relating GANs and structured prediction under statistical decision theory framework. One of the main contribution of the paper is to study/analyze parametric adversarial divergences and link it with structured losses. Although, I see a value in the idea considered in the paper, it is not clear to me how much novelty does this work bring on top of the following two papers: 1) S. Liu. Approximation and convergence properties of generative adversarial learning. In NIPS, 2017. 2) S. Arora. Generalization and equilibrium in generative adversarial nets (GANs). In ICML, 2017. Most of their theoretical results seems to be already existing in literature (Liu, Arora, Arjovsky) in some form of other and it is claimed that this paper put these result in perspective in an attempt to provide a more principled view of the nature and usefulness of adversarial divergences, in comparison to traditional divergences. However, it seems to me that the paper is limited both in theoretical novelty and practical usefulness of these results. Especially, I could not see any novel contribution for GAN literature or adversarial divergences. I would suggests authors to clearly specify novelties and contrast their work with 1) GAN literature: ([2] Arora*s results) 2) Adversarial divergences literature: ([1] Liu) Also, provide more experiments to support several claims (without any rigorous theoretical justifications) made in the paper..\t']"
